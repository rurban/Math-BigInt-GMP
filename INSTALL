Module to replace Math::BigInt's core math routines by using Math::GMP.

This package contains a replacement (drop-in) module for Math::BigInt's core,
Math::BigInt::Calc.pm. It needs the new versions of Math::BigInt and
Math::BigFloat as they are from Perl 5.7.x onwards.

You need to install the Gnu MP library aka libgmp to compile this module.

INSTALL
=======

How to install:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

If you have trouble compiling this package because the GMP library is
installed in a non-standard location, try to pass the INC and LIBS
arguments to Makefile.PL with the appropriate information. Here
is an example:

        perl Makefile.PL\
         INC="-I/apps/perl588/site/gmp-4.2.1/include"\
         LIBS="-L/apps/perl588/site/gmp-4.2.1/lib -lgmp"

USAGE
=====

To use it, replace:

        use Math::BigInt;

with this:

        use Math::BigInt lib => 'GMP';

Since Math::BigInt will fallback to a pure-perl implementation, it is safe
to always use lib => 'GMP'.

Please read the documentation under PERFORMANCE in Math::BigInt on when to
use this module and when not.

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
