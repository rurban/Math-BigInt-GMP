Module to replace Math::BigInt's core math routines by using Math::GMP.

(C) ..--- ----- ----- .---- by - . .-.. ... .-.-.-  All rights reserved.

This package contains a replacement (drop-in) module for Math::BigInt's core,
Math::BigInt::Calc.pm. It needs the new versions of Math::BigInt and
Math::BigFloat as they are from Perl 5.7.x onwards.

How to install:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

To use it, replace:

	use Math::BigInt;

with this:

	use Math::BigInt lib => 'GMP';

Please read the documentation under PERFORMANCE in Math::BigInt on when to
use this module and when not.

More information including HTMLified help and preliminary benchmark results
are available under:

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
