2001-07-22 v1.00 Tels
 * First version (basically working with some quirks)
2001-08-06 v1.01 Tels
 * first release
 * fixed all the bugs in v1.00
 * taken over tests from BigInt v1.40
2001-09-02 v1.02 Tels
 * removed auto-export and added empty import()
 * taken over tests from BigInt v1.42
2001-11-01 v1.03 Tels
 * taken over tests from BigInt v1.45 
 * added _mod() for more speed for $x % $y

	#!/usr/bin/perl -w
	
	use lib 'lib';
	#use lib '../Math-BigInt-GMP-1.02/lib';
	
	use Math::BigInt lib => 'GMP';
	use Benchmark;
	
	my $digits = 1024;
	my $x = Math::BigInt->new('1' . '0' x $digits);
	my $y = Math::BigInt->new('3' . '0' x ($digits - 2) . '3');
	my $u = Math::BigInt->new('3');
	
	timethese ( 2000,
	  {
	  mod_l => sub { $z = $x % $y, },
	  mod_s => sub { $z = $x % $u, },
	  div_l => sub { ($z,$r) = $x->copy()->bdiv($y), },
	  } );

	On a 1 Ghz Athlon with v1.45 of BigInt in ops/s:

		v1.02	v1.03
	mod_s    1100	 2350 
	mod_l    1111    2325
	div_l    1260    1300

2001-11-01 v1.04a Tels (never released)
  * _is_odd()/_is_even() use $two instead of 2: 5600 op/s instead of 4700
2002-01-26 v1.04 Tels
  * use $zero,$one,$two etc instead of 0,1,2 in some routines
  * tests from Math::BigInt v1.50
  * bypass Math::GMP's overload interface and use Math::GMP::gmp_foo() directly
  * added _gcd() and _fac() for more speed in bgcd() and bfac(), respectively
2002-02-16 v1.05 Tels
  * tests from Math::BigInt v1.51
  * replaced _core_lib() by config()->{lib}
  * added _and, _or, _xor (using Math::GMP internal methods)
  * switched _fac over to use Math::GMP gmp_fac()
  * added _sqrt() using gmp_sqrt()
  * used div_two and bdiv_two for _div()
  * tests for _div() in list context and _mod
  * added _from_hex()

  The speedups in band(), bxor(), bior() and bfac() are at least factor 10 for
  small numbers and quickly raise as the numbers grow ;)
  The speedup for bmod() and bdiv() aren't that dramatic, but still worth it.
2002-03-23 v1.06 Tels
  * fixed PREREQUISITES to Math::GMP 2.03, BigInt 1.55
  * fixed typos in CHANGES
  * added _from_bin()
  * testsuite from v1.55

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
