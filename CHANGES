2001-07-22 v1.00 Tels
 * First version (basically working with some quirks)
2001-08-06 v1.01 Tels
 * first release
 * fixed all the bugs in v1.00
 * taken over tests from BigInt v1.40
2001-09-02 v1.02 Tels
 * removed auto-export and added empty import()
 * taken over tests from BigInt v1.42
2001-11-01 v1.03 Tels
 * taken over tests from BigInt v1.45 
 * added _mod() for more speed for $x % $y

	#!/usr/bin/perl -w
	use lib 'lib';
	#use lib '../Math-BigInt-GMP-1.02/lib';
	use Math::BigInt lib => 'GMP';
	use Benchmark;
	my $digits = 1024;
	my $x = Math::BigInt->new('1' . '0' x $digits);
	my $y = Math::BigInt->new('3' . '0' x ($digits - 2) . '3');
	my $u = Math::BigInt->new('3');
	timethese ( 2000,
	  {
	  mod_l => sub { $z = $x % $y, },
	  mod_s => sub { $z = $x % $u, },
	  div_l => sub { ($z,$r) = $x->copy()->bdiv($y), },
	  } );

	On a 1 Ghz Athlon with v1.45 of BigInt in ops/s:
		v1.02	v1.03
	mod_s    1100	 2350 
	mod_l    1111    2325
	div_l    1260    1300

2001-11-01 v1.04a Tels (never released)
  * _is_odd()/_is_even() use $two instead of 2: 5600 op/s instead of 4700
2002-01-26 v1.04 Tels
  * use $zero,$one,$two etc instead of 0,1,2 in some routines
  * tests from Math::BigInt v1.50
  * bypass Math::GMP's overload interface and use Math::GMP::gmp_foo() directly
  * added _gcd() and _fac() for more speed in bgcd() and bfac(), respectively
2002-02-16 v1.05 Tels
  * tests from Math::BigInt v1.51
  * replaced _core_lib() by config()->{lib}
  * added _and, _or, _xor (using Math::GMP internal methods)
  * switched _fac over to use Math::GMP gmp_fac()
  * added _sqrt() using gmp_sqrt()
  * used div_two and bdiv_two for _div()
  * tests for _div() in list context and _mod
  * added _from_hex()

  The speedups in band(), bxor(), bior() and bfac() are at least factor 10 for
  small numbers and quickly raise as the numbers grow ;)
  The speedup for bmod() and bdiv() aren't that dramatic, but still worth it.
2002-03-23 v1.06 Tels
  * testsuite from v1.55 - 3874 tests
  * fixed PREREQUISITES to Math::GMP v2.03, BigInt v1.55
  * fixed typos in CHANGES
  * added _from_bin()
2002-07-07 v1.07 Tels
  * testsuite from BigInt v1.60 - 4054 tests 
  * fixed PREREQUISITES to BigInt v1.60
2002-12-12 v1.08 Tels 4069 tests (never released)
  * added implementation of bmodpow() using GMPs mpow_gmp()
  * release signed by key http://bloodgate.com/tels.asc id 93B84C15
2002-12-15 v1.10a Tels Never released
  * no longer needs Math::GMP (and Carp), but uses own XS layer
  * is thus faster (saves one perl subroutine layer) and less memory hungry
    (it now uses even less memory than using Calc!)
    new XS lets us cut out a subroutine layer
  * new XS will enable us to implement *all* missing functions like _root(),
    _as_hex(), _as_bin() and _rsft(), _lsft()
  * fixed PREREQ to BigInt v1.65
  * extended tests in bigintg.t to cover more functions
2002-12-24 v1.10 Tels 4109 tests
  * Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all!
  * cut out more dead wood from GMP.xs, GMP.so file shrunk a bit
  * added some comments in GMP.xs
  * fixed PREREQ to BigInt v1.64 since v1.65 is not yet out *sigh*
  * more functions like _is_odd()/_is_even()/_acmp() directly in XS - cut away
    perl layer subroutines for more speed (about 10-30% more ops/s for small
    argument or constant cases or other cases where the overhead is greater
    than the actual math operation itself)
  * __stringify() no longer malloc()s a temp. storage => faster
  * added _root(), _lsft() and_rsft() functions for great speedups
  * Running the benchmark script above (adopted a bit) on the same 1 Ghz AMD
    under BigInt v1.64:
    Benchmark: running div_l, mod_l, mod_s for at least 3 CPU seconds...
      div_l:  3s ( 3.20 usr +  0.00 sys =  3.20 CPU) @ 4655.00/s (n=14896)
      mod_l:  4s ( 3.31 usr +  0.00 sys =  3.31 CPU) @ 6851.96/s (n=22680)
      mod_s:  3s ( 3.01 usr +  0.00 sys =  3.01 CPU) @ 7088.37/s (n=21336)
  * Full (memory and other) benchmarks at http://bloodgate.com/perl/bigint/
2003-01-01 v1.11 Tels 4109 tests
  * rewrote stringify_bin() and stringify_hex() to not allocate scratch buffers
    Faster, no longer needs malloc()/free() and strlen().
    Thanx to Sysiphus for pointing this out.
  * removed _as_hex() and _as_bin() from GMP.pm and moved the logic to GMP.xs 
  * documented in todo to replace all malloc()/free() with New and Safefree()
  * removed unused cmp_two() function in GMP.xs
  * removed the unused "$zero = ..."/"$one = ..." in GMP.pm
2003-01-08 v1.12a Tels 4109 tests (not released)
  * removed unused function _mmod from XS code
  * removed unnecc. if len == 0 check in _as_bin(), _as_hex() etc
  * replace some RETVAL = malloc() lines with defined to make changing them
    later much easier
2003-07-04 v1.12b Tels 4491 tests (not released)
  * testsuite from v1.65
  * fixed prereq to require BigInt v1.65
2003-12-11 v1.12 Tels 4677 tests
  * testsuite from v1.67, especialy revamped bigintg.t
  * fixed prereq to require BigInt v1.67
  * added _log_int() to XS code
  * some routines did only return the result, but not modify $x in place
2004-01-10 v1.13 Tels 4759 tests
  * tests from BigInt v1.68
  * removed DESTROY from GMP.pm and made GMP.xs destroy => DESTROY
  * removed _num from GMP.pm and made GMP.xs __stringify => _num
  * removed _modinv() from GMP.pm and fixed up _modinv in GMP.xs
  * disabled the borken _log_int() from the XS code
  * modify $x in place for _dec, _inc, _add, _mod, _mul, _fac, _and, _or,
    _xor, _sqrt, _root and _sub (sub in non-reversed form), this removes some
    malloc/free and makes these ops slightly faster
    (between 10 and 33% in Math::BigInt (!), depending on input and size)
2004-02-15 v1.14 Tels 4867 tests
  * require BigInt v1.70, use tests from it and make API compatible with it
  * _rsft() and _lsft() modify their argument instead of making a copy,
    meaning brsft() and blsft() got about 20% faster in BigInt
  * added a working _zeros() method
  * added a working _log_int() method
2004-11-22 v1.15 Tels 5112 tests
  * some small cleanups in the Perl code
  * changed "class" to "Class" to avoid the reserved keyword for MS compiler
  * do not pull unused parameter "Class" from stack - avoid compiler warnings
  * put _sub() into XS for more speed and smaller memory footprint
  * testsuite from MBI v1.73
2004-12-09 v1.16 Tels 5112 tests
  * fixed a leak in _div() (Thanx Tassilo v. Parsival!)
  * put _div() into XS, making division slightly faster for small numbers
  * put leak.pl and leaktest into MANIFEST for later checking

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
