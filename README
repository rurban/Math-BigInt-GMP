Module to replace Math::BigInt's core math routines by using Math::GMP.

(C) 2001 by TELS. All rights reserved.

This package contains a replacement (drop-in) module for Math::BigInt's core,
Math::BigInt::Calc.pm. It needs the new versions of Math::BigInt and
Math::BigFloat as they are from Perl 5.7.x onwards.

You need to install the Gnu MP library aka libgmp to compile this module.

How to install (replace the version below with the current one):

        tar -xzf Math-BigInt-GMP-1.12.tar.gz
        cpansign --verify

If the signature does not verify ok, you might to install Module::Signature
and get my key from <http://bloodgate.com/tels.asc>.

If the signature still does not verify okay, notify me. DO NO INSTALL this
package when the signature is BAD - your system might get compromised!

If the signature is good, do:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test

and then as root:

        make install


To use this module, replace:

        use Math::BigInt;

with this:

        use Math::BigInt lib => 'GMP';

or alternatively something like:

        use Math::BigInt lib => 'GMP,Pari,BitVect';

Please read the documentation under PERFORMANCE in Math::BigInt on when to
use this module and when not. As of v1.10 and Math::BigInt v1.64/v1.64, using
"lib => 'GMP'" will actually reduce the memory consumption of your program,
and thanx to the fact that we no longer use Math::GMP but have our own XS
code, almost all operations should be faster than just using Calc (the
default pure-perl library used in Math::BigInt).

So, the following:

        use Math::BigInt lib => 'GMP';

can be heartily recommended.

More information including HTMLified help and preliminary benchmark results
are available under:

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
